# Pawn Parade

This is an application to manage chess leagues and tournaments.

## Vision

This app exists to help anyone organize a chess league. This especially includes scholastic chess leagues, where a league might be formed within one or more school districts. League administrators can keep league play rules and a tournament schedule. Coaches can manage their team rosters. Tournament directors within the league can publish tournament announcements onto a schedule. Coaches can coordinate with players or their parent/guardian and manage tournament preregistration, eliminating a barage of paper flyers and emails. 

Tournament directors will have an easier time getting the roster of people together to enter into the chess pairings. They can also publish the official results. League administrators can run a "grand prix" where awards are given for results across a season.

## Status

Vaporware.

We just got started. The good news is that this project was born free under a GPL'd open source license. The bad news is that it's still a newborn. We'll be adding features as we go, and intend have a very tight release cycle. 

## Development Methodology

We intend this project to be run using the best practices of software development. In summer of 2013, this means open source, holistic devops, continuous integration / continuous delivery, 100% test driven development using a behavior driven development approach.
